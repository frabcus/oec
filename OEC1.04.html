<h1 class="c0"><span>Open Employment Contract (alpha version)</span></h1>

<p class="c0"><span>UK Version 1.0 alpha</span><span>4</span><span> +
</span><span>Remote Working</span><span> + Average Hours Flexitime + UK Base +
No Collective Agreements + Co-location</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0 c15"><span class="c2">This is an experimental version of an open
system for employment contracts. Both parties will apply common sense and good
faith to its interpretation.</span></p>

<h2 class="c1 c0"><span>Statement of Particulars of Employment</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span>This document doubles as a written statement of the
particulars of your employment which we are obliged to give you by section 1 of
the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the terms and conditions of your contract of
employment with us.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>This contract consists of a set of “core” terms and the
following options:</span></p>

<p class="c0 c24"><span><a href="#option-remote-working">Remote Working</a>
(you will normally work from home or other place of your choice)</span></p>

<p class="c0 c24"><span><a href="option-average-hours-flexitime">Average Hours
Flexitime</a> (your hours of work are an average and there is flexibility about
going under or over those hours)</span></p>

<p class="c0 c24"><span><a href="#option-united-kingdom-base">UK Base</a> (you
will be primarily based in the UK and we will never require you to work outside
the UK for more than a month at any one time </span><span>unless by mutual
agreement</span><span class="c23">)</span></p>

<p class="c0 c24"><span><a href="#option-no-collective-agreements">No
Collective Agreements</a> (there are no collective agreements — such as with
a union — affecting your employment)</span></p>

<p class="c0 c24"><span><a href="#option-co-location">Co-location</a> (we may
require you to work in the offices of other organisations)</span></p>
<hr>

<h2 class="c0"><span>Core terms</span></h2>

<p class="c0"><span>This part of the contract sets out the core terms of the
open employment contract. There may be one or more additional optional sets of
terms selected by us which will appear after the core terms. The optional sets
also form a part of the contract and are not meant to contradict anything in
the core terms. In the event that they do, a later term overrides an earlier
term.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Employee specific information</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>The following table (referred to in the rest of the
contract as "the particulars") sets out information specific to your employment
which varies from the standard OEC version 1.0. The words in italics in the
left hand column are to aid your employer in entering the correct information
in the right hand column. </span></p>

</table>
<a href="#" name="id.b399wbad097s"></a> 

<h3 class="c0"><span>Date of Commencement:</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>Your employment will start on the date given as the “date
of commencement” in the particulars.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>This date will be the date for the purposes of
calculating your statutory period of continuous employment with the company
unless a different date is specified in th</span><span>at</span><span> table.
This takes into account any unbroken employment with us, or any associated
company and any other service we are required to include as a matter of law.
Service with a previous employer will not ordinarily count as part of your
continuous period of employment with us.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Pay</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>You must always maintain a suitable bank or building
society account into which payment can be made, and provide us with current
details of it. Changes to your bank or building society details must be
notified to us in writing.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>If your pay is calculated annually, y</span><span>ou will
be paid 1/12 of your annual pay (as specified in the particulars) each month.
If your pay is calculated monthly, that is the amount you will receive each
month.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>If your pay is given hourly, then you will be paid for the
actual number of hours you have worked in any month. For the purposes of hourly
pay, we may choose to start a “month” on any particular day of the month,
eg we may pay you for the hours you work from 4th of one month until 3rd of the
next.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Payment is made </span><span>each month by transfer to your
bank or building society account.</span><span> </span><span>The day on which
we will instruct payment to take place is indicated in the “when payment
takes place” box in the particulars. </span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>If an overpayment occurs (in other words if we pay money to
you to which you </span><span>were</span><span> not entitled) we reserve the
right to deduct the amount of any overpayment from any payment due to you from
us (for example your salary), or to recover the amount directly from
you.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><a name="h.3znysh7"></a><span>Location</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>Your base is where we may require you to work some or all
of the time. Most employers will specify a base, but if we have written
“none” it means you have no base - perhaps because you will work from home
or be peripatetic. The box labelled “location” in the particulars gives the
location of your first base if you have one. </span><span> </span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>If you do have a base, w</span><span>e will ordinarily
allow you to work from </span><span>home</span><span> or other location of
your choosing if the nature of your work allows it and </span><span>the place
from which you intend to work </span><span>is suitable for the work you are
doing. Unless we have agreed otherwise </span><span>or you are working on a
remote working contract, w</span><span>e may sti</span><span>ll
</span><span>require you to come to</span><span> your base some or all of the
time. </span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>We may change your base to any other place within the area
indicated by the “range of alternatives” entry in the
particulars</span><span>, but we will give you reasonable advance notice of the
change.</span><span> Unless this contract includes the “co-location” or
“foreign working” options, we cannot require you to work permanently from
anywhere else.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>We may from time to time require you
</span><span>to</span><span class="c21"> attend </span><span
class="c21">client or project related meetings</span><span
class="c21">,</span><span class="c21"> c</span><span>onferences or other
events. These may be away from your base (if you have one). We will pay any
necessary travel and overnight expenses incurred by your attendance at such
events and we will do our best to give reasonable notice consistent with the
needs of our business.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c5"><span>Travel time to or from work inside the area designated
as your "travel area" in the particulars, will not normally count towards your
working hours </span><span>(eg for the purposes of flexitime or salary based on
hours worked) unless you carry out actual work while you are travelling. Eg if
you work remotely on the train. </span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>If you are travelling to somewhere outside your travel
area, we will ordinarily count at least some of your travel time as “working
time”. Exactly how we treat your travelling time for working time purposes
will be a matter for us, but we will try to be reasonable about it and comply
with any relevant laws in coming to a decision</span><span>. If you are unhappy
with the way in which we have compensated you for travel outside your travel
area, you should let your line manager know.  </span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Hours of Work:</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>We do not specify specific hours for you to start or end
work, nor is there a “normal working day”.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>What we expect you to do is produce work that a competent
person with your job description would produce working for the same length of
time as you. It is up to you to make sure that your starting and ending work
times are appropriate for the work you have to do. </span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Some of your working time will be specifically timetabled
by us, for example for meetings and telephone calls, but the organisation of
the rest of your time will be a matter for you. Depending on the needs of the
business we may schedule all, some or none of your time.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>We will try to ensure that tasks allocated to you for
specific times occur at reasonable times of the day and on weekdays (Monday to
Friday) but the needs of the business may require you to carry out tasks at
unusual times, for example if you are required to conduct a telephone
conference with an overseas client.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>We will ensure that any demands on your time outside hours
generally considered to be “working” or “office” hours will not be
unreasonable in the circumstances, and in particular, taking into account the
nature of what we ask you to do and the time we ask you to do it.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>We will require you to record your hours of work
(particularly if you are working hourly) in any reasonable manner we
choose.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>We do not give any </span><span>performance
bonuses</span><span> under this contract.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Probation</span></h3>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>During your probationary period, you may be dismissed
without notice. If we dismiss you during your probationary period we do not
have to give you any reason for doing so unless we are required to do so by
law.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Notice Periods:</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>Except in cases of gross misconduct when we reserve the
right to terminate your employment without notice, your employment will only
end either by us giving notice to you or you giving notice to us.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>There is only one notice period under your contract — we
will give you the same period of notice as you are obliged to give to
us.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>After the end of your probationary period, the notice
period will be that given in the particulars</span><span>, unless the statutory
minimum notice is longer, in which case the statutory minimum will
apply.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>At the time this contract was written,
the</span><span> statutory minimum notice period was 1 week</span><span> for
each completed year of continuous service up to a maximum of 12
weeks.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Notice to quit will only be effective if given in
</span><span>writing</span><span>. The Staff Handbook will give details of who
to give the notice to and how the notice should be given.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>Once a notice to quit has been given (whether from you
to us, or from us to you), we reserve the right, at any time after the notice
was given while you are still employed with us, to give you pay in lieu of
notice. This means that we will pay you as a lump sum, the salary that would
otherwise be payable to you during the unexpired portion of your notice
period.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Holiday entitlement:</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>We operate a holiday year as described in the
particulars.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>The amount of paid leave you may take is indicated in the
“holiday” box in the particulars. This amount of leave includes a notional
allowance for public holidays but you are not necessarily expected to take
leave on those days.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>In the first year of your employment your leave will be
reduced on a pro-rata basis, by the ratio of the number of days you work in
that holiday year to the number of working days in that year (for example
260).</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>If you are paid hourly, work irregular hours or
part-time</span><span> we will work out your “holiday pay” (i.e. the
amount that you will earn for paid holidays) as follows. Your pay will be a
proportion of your total annual earnings based on the fraction of time you
spend on holiday compared with the rest of the year. For example if you have
5.6 weeks (28 weekdays) holiday in a normal year then your total holiday pay
would be 12.03% of your total earnings for that year. </span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>You must give us advance notice before taking your holiday
equal to 4 times the number of days of holiday you will be taking. We reserve
the right to require longer notice, or to refuse a particular period of notice,
where we have a legitimate reason -- for example because of business deadlines.
In such cases we will make every reasonable effort to ensure that you are able
to take the leave to which you are entitled at a later date.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>You may carry over a maximum of </span><span>5
days</span><span>' holiday (or 40 hours holiday pay if you are paid
hourly</span><span>) </span><span>from one holiday year to the next.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>If you leave the company, you will receive payment in
lieu for any part of your holiday entitlement which has accrued but which has
not been taken. Similarly, if you have taken more holiday than you have
accrued, we will deduct the appropriate amount of pay from any payment due from
us to you on the termination of your employment or, if this is insufficient, we
will require you to make up any shortfall.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Absence from Work</span></h3>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>Absence from work due to
</span><span>illness</span><span> is governed by our absence policy found in
the Staff Handbo</span><span>ok. If we have indicated anything (other than
“none”) against “sick pay” in the particulars, these are the main terms
that govern payment during periods of absence due to illness. </span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>We will only pay you while you are absent due to illness
if you have complied with any reasonable conditions (including how to report
yourself absent) that we may impose from time to time as part of our absence
policy.</span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>If, for whatever reason, you do not receive sick pay
under this contract, you may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Pension</span></h3>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>We do not </span><span>operate</span><span> any
employee pension scheme. </span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Retirement</span></h3>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>We do not set any compulsory retirement age.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Confidentiality</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>You will not use nor disclose to any other person any
confidential information acquired by you during the course of your employment
for any purpose other than the performance of your duties.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>After your employment with us, any information that is
sufficiently confidential as to amount to a trade secret must not be used by
you in any future employment, or be disclosed to any other person, while that
information retains its quality as a trade secret.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>On ending your employment with us you must return to us any
physical documents given to you, or generated by you, during the course of your
employment.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>During your employment, you may be given permission to take
copies of documents, including computer programs, planning documents and
ancillary documentation, in which copyright subsists. Copies may be made
available to you in different ways — for example by giving you access to a
version control repository. Unless we agree otherwise, your licence to retain
and use copies of any such material is limited to the period of your employment
with us.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>Once you have ceased to work with us you agree that you
will delete all copies of any such material (including any backup copies) that
remain in your possession or control.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Loyalty</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>You agree that while you are employed by us you will not,
without our prior written consent, carry out any work for or take employment
with any employer who is or could reasonably become a competitor of our
company. Similarly, you agree not to carry out any work for any employer who is
or could reasonably become a client of our company, other than the work you do
as part of your employment with us.</span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>You may carry out any other work provided it does not
interfere with the performance of your duties working for us.</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Quality</span></h3>

<p class="c0"><span>During your employment with us, you must complete your work
to the best of your ability, and at all times must carry out your work in
accordance with our Quality Management Policy.</span></p>

<p class="c5 c0"><span>For further details, consult the Staff
Handbook</span></p>

<h3 class="c0 c18"><span>Disciplinary Rules</span></h3>

employment are contained in the Staff Handbook.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Further rules concerning your employment with us are
contained in the Staff Handbook. Unless otherwise indicated, the contents of
the Staff Handbook form a part of your contract of employment. It is your duty
as an employee to familiarise yourself with the contents of the Staff
Handbook.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c14"><span></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>The contents of the Staff Handbook will be varied by us

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., http://fsf.org/ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                        Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                    NO WARRANTY
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

{description} Copyright (C) {year} {fullname}

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands show w' andshow c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than show w' andshow c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. +830dc37bda9b6afb2e5196795f9c5f7b992a0137 +======================================== + +diff: 0000 How can I get bitcoins?

Over 2 Million BTC Processed Introduction

The blockchain receive payments API is the quickest and easiest way to begin accepting automated bitcoin payments. Consisting of just two simple http GET requests you can be up and running in minutes with no account or approval needed.

One of the difficulties involved with receiving bitcoin payments is the need to generate a unique address for each new user or invoice. These addresses need to monitored and stored securely. The blockchain receive payments API takes care of the generation and monitoring of addresses. We will notify your server using a simple callback whenever a payment is received.

You provide a bitcoin address we generate unique addresses that forwards payments to that address instantly notifying a callback URL. Obtaining A Bitcoin Address Our API requires only one bitcoin address

The receive payment API requires that you have at least one bitcoin address in which all payments will be forwarded to. The private key for this address does not need to be shared with us and can be kept offline for increased security.

Cold Storage - Provide protection from hackers by receiving payments directly into a cold storage address or paper wallet. An Exchange Wallet - Use the deposit address of your bitcoin exchange to directly receive BTC ready for exchange into your local currency. Although beyond the scope of this documentation you can even setup a trade bot to automatically trade any bitcoin balance to Fiat currency minimizing the exposure to volatile exchange rates. Other Bitcoin Client - Use a bitcoin address from a desktop client such as Bitcoin-QT or multibit. My Wallet - Sign up for a My Wallet account and receive payments into any client side encrypted address. Generating Receiving Addresses API call to generate a new bitcoin address ready to receive payments.

This method creates a unique address which should be presented to the customer. Any payments sent to this address will be forwarded to your own bitcoin address. Each time a payment is forwarded the callback URL will be called.

The minimum supported transaction size is 0.0005 BTC. Forwarding transactions will include a network fee paid by blockchain.info.

https://blockchain.info/api/receive?method=create&address=$receiving_address&callback=$callback_url

$receiving_address Your Receiving Bitcoin Address (Where you would like the payment to be sent) $callback_url The callback URL to be notified when a payment is received. Remember to URL Encode the callback url when calling the create method.
